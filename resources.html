	<h2>NetLogo Resources</h2>
	<p><a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/" target="_blank" >NetLogo</a> is a widely used, open source agent-based modeling language and environment. The software comes preloaded with a wide variety of models, including the models for this textbook. The models in NetLogo's models library are <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/index.cgi" target="_blank" >available online</a>. Additional NetLogo models submitted by members of the NetLogo community can be found on the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/index.cgi" target="_blank" >Community Models Page</a> and on the <a href="http://modelingcommons.org/" target="_blank" >Modeling Commons</a>, an online community for NetLogo modelers. For additional information about NetLogo, please consult the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/" target="_blank" >NetLogo website</a> and the online <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/" target="_blank" >NetLogo User Manual</a>.</p>
	<p>NetLogo is developed and maintained by the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank" >Center for Connected Learning and Computer-based Modeling</a> at Northwestern University. It is widely used in classrooms and research labs around the world. NetLogo curricula can be found <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/#Curriculum" target="_blank" >here</a> and an extensive list of research papers that use NetLogo is available <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/references.shtml" target="_blank" >here</a>.</p>

	<h3>NetLogo Extensions</h3>
	<p>NetLogo was designed to be easily extendable. As a result there are a large number of extensions for NetLogo available that provide additional features to tool. NetLogo comes bundled with a number of extensions including a <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/GIS-Extension" target="_blank" >GIS extension</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Sound-Extension" target="_blank" >sound extension</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NW-Extension" target="_blank" >networks extension</a> that adds a number of network analysis primitives to the NetLogo language. Additional extensions are available on NetLogo's <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Extensions" target="_blank" >GitHub Extensions page</a>. Notable non-bundled extensions include the <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Web-Extension" target="_blank" >Web extension</a> that allows your to import/export data via HTTP and the <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Custom-Logging-Extension/" target="_blank" >custom logging extensions</a> for tracking user interactions with NetLogo models.</p>
