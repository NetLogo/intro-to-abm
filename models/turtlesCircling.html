	<P>## WHAT IS IT?<br><P>
	This is a new kind of mathematical investigation â€” we are investigating the emergent shape created by the movement of many turtles moving independently in simple ways. Each turtle is moving so as to create a circle of a fixed radius (set by the RADIUS slider).  What happens if the radius they are all circling at is changed in mid-action? Guess before you try it.<br><P>
	## HOW IT WORKS<br><P>
	The turtles create their circles by moving forward a little and turning right a little so as to end up with a circle of the specified radius. We start all the turtles on a circle of that radius so they move around the circle.<br><P>
	## HOW TO USE IT<br><P>
	The NUMBER slider determines the number of turtles circling.<br><P>
	The RADIUS slider determines the size of the circle each turtle moves on.<br><P>
	The SPEED slider determines how large a step each turtle take at each clock tick -- it determines the speed of circling.<br><P>
	The SETUP button creates NUMBER turtles on a circle of radius RADIUS centered at the point (0 0). The turtles are all headed so as to move around the circle.<br><P>
	The ALL-CIRCLE button starts the turtles circling. They are each drawing their own circle of radius RADIUS.<br><P>
	Change the value of the RADIUS slider while the turtles are circling.  *Before* you do it, what is your guess as to what will happen when you change the RADIUS?<br><P>
	## THINGS TO NOTICE<br><P>
	What is happening to the shape described by the turtles?<br><P>
	How far out do the turtles go?<br><P>
	How far in do they come?<br><P>
	## THINGS TO TRY<br><P>
	Try different values of both starting radius and changed radius.<br><P>
	You can also do further investigations with the following controls:<br><P>
	The ZERO-CIRCLE button lets you just focus on turtle zero's movement -- all the rest are stopped.<br><P>
	The DRAW-CIRCLE button lets you draw a circle on the patches with a radius equal to DRAW-RAD. This way you can track the movement of the turtles.<br><P>
	If the PLOT? switch is on, the plot will show a plot of turtle zero's distance from the origin as the turtles circle.<br><P>
	Try the command `lt 50` while the turtles are circling. Is this the same behavior as you observed when changing the radius?<br><P>
	In the Command Center, get a single (or several) turtles to trace their path using the command `pen-down` (`pd`).  This may help to show the relationship between the circles of individual turtles and the circle you see as they all move together.<br><P>
	## EXTENDING THE MODEL<br><P>
	What tools can you build to help visualize what is going on?<br><P>
	## NETLOGO FEATURES<br><P>
	The `display` command is used for smooth animation.<br><P>
