  <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

      On page 46, the caption for Figure 2.1 should read:

    On page 73, the text reads:
      <blockquote>
        Now that we have verified that our SETUP procedure seems to be working well, we are ready for our GO procedure.
      </blockquote>
      After "well" there should be the following footnote:
      <blockquote>
        There is in fact a subtle bug in the SETUP procedure. Finding it is an exercise for the reader.  See exploration 13.

    </li>

    <li id="p79">On page 79, in box 2.8, the text refers to the PERSONALITIES slider it should say chooser.

    <li>
      In page 79, the following is stated:

      <blockquote>
        the ACT-BRAVELY code points the turtle toward the midpoint between the friend and enemy, while the ACT-COWARDLY code points the turtle toward a point that is as far away from its FRIEND as the FRIEND is from the ENEMY. (See figures 2.32 and 2.33.)
      </blockquote>

      The first statement regarding a brave agent is correct. However, a more accurate description of a coward agent should be “the ACT-COWARDLY code points the turtle toward a point that is <i>half</i> as far from its FRIEND as the FRIEND is from the ENEMY”. In other words, according to the code and figure, the coward would like to hide and stay “close” to its friend.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The code for the heroes and cowards model is deliberately not quite correct. In exploration 13, we ask readers to find and fix the bug.  Here is a link to a corrected version of the model: <a href='othermodels/Heroes and Cowards (exploration 13).nlogo' class="model-download-link">Heroes and Cowards (exploration 13)</a>

        Both “netlogo-users” and “stackoverflow” have many NetLogo experts who are usually very responsive to questions.

      we would like to add the additional information:

        You may also want to use the Profiler extension that is bundled with NetLogo and can help identify bottlenecks in your code (see the documentation at http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/profiler.html).

      On pages 427-428, explorations 26 through 30 rely on downloading your Facebook network using a tool called Netvizz. Facebook has recently changed its policies regarding these sorts of tools and has been shutting them down in recent months. Consequently, in order to stay functional, Netvizz has had to remove its ability to download personal networks. You can read more about this on <a href='http://thepoliticsofsystems.net/2015/01/the-end-of-netvizz/'>Netvizz's announcement</a>.

      <br/><br/>

      <a href='http://snacourse.com/getnet/'>GetNet</a>, a similar tool, is still  operational, and exports in a format supported by the NetLogo network extension (GML). However, there is a good chance that it, too, will be shutdown in coming months. Using GetNet instead of Netvizz, exploration 26 should read as follows:

      <blockquote>
        26. Many websites provide interfaces and APIs where you can access data sets. For example, GetNet provides an interface for obtaining your Facebook network. Using the network extension, we can load and analyze the network in NetLogo.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you have a Facebook account, go to <a href='http://snacourse.com/getnet/'>http://snacourse.com/getnet/</a> and follow the instructions for downloading your network. After completing step 2, GetNet will assemble your personal Facebook network and give you the option to download it as a GML file. Go ahead and do this. Next, open the GML file in a text editor such as Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on OS X). You will see entries that look like the following:

        <pre>
        node [
          id 1
          label "Jane Smith"
          sex "female"
          wallcount 52
        ]</pre>

        The actual node attributes will vary depending on your choices when generating the network.
        <br/><br/>

        Next, create a new NetLogo model. In order for NetLogo to import the node attributes in the GML file, you must declare them as turtle variables. For the above node to be fully imported, this looks like:

        <pre>
        turtles-own [ id sex wallcount ]</pre>

        Remember, LABEL is a built-in turtle variable and so does not need to be declared. Once you have done that, loading your network is just one command

        <pre>
        nw:load-gml “/path/to/your/network.graphml” turtles links</pre>

        This will create a turtle for each of your friends and the links between them. Now it is time to play with your friends! Can you visualize your network better by using layout-spring? It's very likely that your network will naturally cluster into several groups. By examining the turtle labels in these groups, can you figure out what each group corresponds to? Can you figure out which of your friends are most central by using centrality measures available in the network extension? (See <a href='http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/nw.html'>the network extension's webpage</a> for documentation.)
