  <h2> Updates to the Book </h2>
  Since the book was published, a number of revisions and updates to the book's text have been made. The latest version of the text (and updated models when applicable) is listed below.

  <h3>Preface</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Page xvi refers to the "IABM" folder of the models library. It should be the "IABM Textbook" folder.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The footnote on page 60 refers to the "IABM Models" folder of the models library. It should be the "IABM Textbook" folder.</li>

    <li>
      In page 79, the following is stated:

      <blockquote>
        the ACT-BRAVELY code points the turtle toward the midpoint between the friend and enemy, while the ACT-COWARDLY code points the turtle toward a point that is as far away from its FRIEND as the FRIEND is from the ENEMY. (See figures 2.32 and 2.33.)
      </blockquote>

      The first statement regarding a brave agent is correct. However, a more accurate description of a coward agent should be “the ACT-COWARDLY code points the turtle toward a point that is <i>half</i> as far from its FRIEND as the FRIEND is from the ENEMY”. In other words, according to the code and figure, the coward would like to hide and stay “close” to its friend.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The code for the heroes and cowards model is deliberately not quite correct. In exploration 13, we ask readers to find and fix the bug.  Here is a link to a corrected version of the model: <a href='models/Heroes and Cowards (exploration 13).nlogo' class="model-download-link">Heroes and Cowards (exploration 13).nlogo</a>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Page 110 refers to the "IABM" folder of the models library. It should be the "IABM Textbook" folder.</li>
    <li>
      Pages 152 and 154, explorations 3, 7, and 22 through 25 refer to the "Segregation model". They should instead refer to the "Segregation Simple model" found in the models library at IABM Textbook &gt; chapter 3 &gt; Segregation Extensions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Page 153, exploration 12 refers the extension of the "Fire model". It should instead refer the extensions of the "Fire Simple model" found in the models library at IABM Textbook &gt; chapter 3 &gt; Fire Extensions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>On page 218, there is code that says "forward10" (no space between the word and number). It should say "forward 10".</li>

    <li>
      On page 218, the text below appears:

      <blockquote>
        This can be confusing when first thinking about agentsets, but really, this is a variant of the same issue you run into whenever you take action based on the condition of a variable and that action affects the value of the same variable.
      </blockquote>

      Below is the corrected text:

      <blockquote>
        This can be confusing when first thinking about agentsets, but really, this is a variant of the same issue you run into whenever you condition action based on the value of a variable and that action affects the value of the same variable.
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      On page 228, the following text appears: "To implement the goal-based version of the model". It should be expanded as follow:
      <blockquote>
        To implement the goal-based version of the model (the traffic-grid-goal model found in the chapter 5 subfolder of the IABM TEXTBOOK folder of the NetLogo models library),
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      On page 261, the following text appears:
      <blockquote>The Ants model demonstrates this kind of interaction when the ants examine the environment to look for food and sense pheromone:</blockquote>
      It should be expanded as follows:
      <blockquote>The Ants model (which we saw in chapter one, and is in the biology section of the NetLogo models library) demonstrates this kind of interaction when the ants examine the environment to look for food and sense pheromone:</blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>Page 277, refers to the "IABM" folder of the models library. It should be the "IABM Textbook" folder.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      On page 360, the following text appears:
      <blockquote>For instance, in the Disease model described in the preceding box</blockquote>
      It should say:
      <blockquote>For instance, in the Disease HubNet model described above</blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      On page 375, the textbook is assuming you are using the latest version of the gogoboard hardware, which uses an HID (Human Interface Device) interface. If you have an older version of the board that uses the serial interface, then load the gogo-serial extension.
    </li>

    <li>
      On page 400, the code for the setup procedure of the Sandpile Simple model is shown as follows:
      <pre>
      to setup [setup-task]
        clear-all
        ask patches [
          ;; n is set to the result of running the initial-task (which is an input to the
          ;; set procedure)
          set n runresult setup-task
          recolor
        ]
        set total sum [n] of patches
        reset-ticks
      end
      </pre>

      It should actually be:

      <pre>
      to setup [setup-task]
        clear-all
        ask patches [
          ;; n is set to the result of running the initial-task (which is an input to the
          ;; set procedure)
          set n runresult setup-task
          recolor
        ]
        set total sum [n] of patches
        ;; set this to the empty list so we can add items to it later
        set sizes []
        reset-ticks
      end
      </pre>
    </li>

      Chapter 8:

      On pages 427-428, explorations 26 through 30 rely on downloading your Facebook network using a tool called Netvizz. Facebook has recently changed its policies regarding these sorts of tools and has been shutting them down in recent months. Consequently, in order to stay functional, Netvizz has had to remove its ability to download personal networks. You can read more about this on <a href='http://thepoliticsofsystems.net/2015/01/the-end-of-netvizz/'>Netvizz's announcement</a>.

      <br/><br/>

      <a href='http://snacourse.com/getnet/'>GetNet</a>, a similar tool, is still  operational, and exports in a format supported by the NetLogo network extension (GML). However, there is a good chance that it, too, will be shutdown in coming months. Using GetNet instead of Netvizz, exploration 26 should read as follows:

      <blockquote>
        26. Many websites provide interfaces and APIs where you can access data sets. For example, GetNet provides an interface for obtaining your Facebook network. Using the network extension, we can load and analyze the network in NetLogo.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you have a Facebook account, go to <a href='http://snacourse.com/getnet/'>http://snacourse.com/getnet/</a> and follow the instructions for downloading your network. After completing step 2, GetNet will assemble your personal Facebook network and give you the option to download it as a GML file. Go ahead and do this. Next, open the GML file in a text editor such as Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on OS X). You will see entries that look like the following:

        <pre>
        node [
          id 1
          label "Jane Smith"
          sex "female"
          wallcount 52
        ]</pre>

        The actual node attributes will vary depending on your choices when generating the network.
        <br/><br/>

        Next, create a new NetLogo model. In order for NetLogo to import the node attributes in the GML file, you must declare them as turtle variables. For the above node to be fully imported, this looks like:

        <pre>
        turtles-own [ id sex wallcount ]</pre>

        Remember, LABEL is a built-in turtle variable and so does not need to be declared. Once you have done that, loading your network is just one command

        <pre>
        nw:load-gml “/path/to/your/network.graphml” turtles links</pre>

        This will create a turtle for each of your friends and the links between them. Now it is time to play with your friends! Can you visualize your network better by using layout-spring? It's very likely that your network will naturally cluster into several groups. By examining the turtle labels in these groups, can you figure out what each group corresponds to? Can you figure out which of your friends are most central by using centrality measures available in the network extension? (See <a href='http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/nw.html'>http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/nw.html</a> for documentation.)
