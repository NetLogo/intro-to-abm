  <h2> Updates to the Book </h2>
  Since the book was published, a number of revisions and updates to the book's text have been made. The latest version of the text (and updated models when applicable) is listed below.

  <h3>Preface</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Page xvi refers to the "IABM" folder of the models library. It should be the "IABM Textbook" folder.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The footnote on page 60 refers to the "IABM Models" folder of the models library. It should be the "IABM Textbook" folder.</li>

    <li>
      In page 79, the following is stated:

      <blockquote>
        the ACT-BRAVELY code points the turtle toward the midpoint between the friend and enemy, while the ACT-COWARDLY code points the turtle toward a point that is as far away from its FRIEND as the FRIEND is from the ENEMY. (See figures 2.32 and 2.33.)
      </blockquote>

      The first statement regarding a brave agent is correct. However, a more accurate description of a coward agent should be “the ACT-COWARDLY code points the turtle toward a point that is ***half*** as far from its FRIEND as the FRIEND is from the ENEMY”. In other words, according to the code and figure, the coward would like to hide and stay “close” to its friend.
      <br/>
      Finally, the code for this model is not completely correct. It allows an agent to choose the same other agent as both its friend and its enemy. The corrected version is in the models library.

    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Chapter 3</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Page 110 refers to the "IABM" folder of the models library. It should be the "IABM Textbook" folder.</li>
    <li>
      Pages 152 and 154, explorations 3, 7, and 22 through 25 refer to the "Segregation model". They should instead refer to the "Segregation Simple model" found in the models library at IABM Textbook &gt; chapter 3 &gt; Segregation Extensions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Page 153, exploration 12 refers the extension of the "Fire model". It should instead refer the extensions of the "Fire Simple model" found in the models library at IABM Textbook &gt; chapter 3 &gt; Fire Extensions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>On page 218, there is code that says "forward10" (no space between the word and number). It should say "forward 10".</li>

    <li>
      On page 218, the text below appears:

      <blockquote>
        This can be confusing when first thinking about agentsets, but really, this is a variant of the same issue you run into whenever you take action based on the condition of a variable and that action affects the value of the same variable.
      </blockquote>

      Below is the corrected text:

      <blockquote>
        This can be confusing when first thinking about agentsets, but really, this is a variant of the same issue you run into whenever you condition action based on the value of a variable and that action affects the value of the same variable.
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      On page 228, the following text appears: "To implement the goal-based version of the model". It should be expanded as follow:
      <blockquote>
        To implement the goal-based version of the model (the traffic-grid-goal model found in the chapter 5 subfolder of the IABM TEXTBOOK folder of the NetLogo models library),
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      On page 261, the following text appears:
      <blockquote>The Ants model demonstrates this kind of interaction when the ants examine the environment to look for food and sense pheromone:</blockquote>
      It should be expanded as follows:
      <blockquote>The Ants model (which we saw in chapter one, and is in the biology section of the NetLogo models library) demonstrates this kind of interaction when the ants examine the environment to look for food and sense pheromone:</blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>Page 277, refers to the "IABM" folder of the models library. It should be the "IABM Textbook" folder.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Chapter 8</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      On page 360, the following text appears:
      <blockquote>For instance, in the Disease model described in the preceding box</blockquote>
      It should say:
      <blockquote>For instance, in the Disease HubNet model described above</blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      On page 375, the textbook is assuming you are using the latest version of the gogoboard hardware, which uses an HID (Human Interface Device) interface. If you have an older version of the board that uses the serial interface, then load the gogo-serial extension.
    </li>
  </ul>
