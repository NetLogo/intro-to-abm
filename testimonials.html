			<p class="quote-body">This book eloquently captures the excitement of understanding natural and social phenomena by recreating them in computer simulations.  The agent-based approach championed here provides deeply satisfying scientific explanations because it provides a bridge between levels of description, showing how high-level, macroscopic properties such as crystal formation, tumor shape, flocking, population cycles, social coordination, and transportation networks, can spontaneously emerge from lower-level interactions among agents rather than being explicitly programmed into a model.  When combined with active exploration using Uri Wilensky's free and widely used NetLogo programming environment, reading this book equips students and researchers with a new language for generating and expressing scientific theories.  Models only behave as they are explicitly instructed using this rigorous formal language, and yet their creators will experience the uncanny and highly instructive phenomenon of being utterly surprised by the high-level patterns generated by the models they themselves build.</p> <div class="quote" style="float:right;">&#8221;</div>

			<p class="quote-body">This outstanding book offers a tour d’horizon of agent-based modeling for students, teachers, and scientists at all levels, using NetLogo, the ‘low-threshold/unknown-ceiling’ language developed by Uri Wilensky. With this Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling, he and William Rand have set the standard for textbooks on this topic. An essential contribution.</p><div class="quote" style="float:right;">&#8221;</div>

			<p class="quote-body">A clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date introduction. This is the best book out there for learning (or teaching) the art and science of agent-based modeling. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in this essential area of complex systems science.</p><div class="quote" style="float:right;">&#8221;</div>
