			<p class="quote-body">This book eloquently captures the excitement of understanding natural and social phenomena by recreating them in computer simulations.  The agent-based approach championed here provides deeply satisfying scientific explanations because it provides a bridge between levels of description, showing how high-level, macroscopic properties such as crystal formation, tumor shape, flocking, population cycles, social coordination, and transportation networks, can spontaneously emerge from lower-level interactions among agents rather than being explicitly programmed into a model.  When combined with active exploration using Uri Wilensky's free and widely used NetLogo programming environment, reading this book equips students and researchers with a new language for generating and expressing scientific theories.  Models only behave as they are explicitly instructed using this rigorous formal language, and yet their creators will experience the uncanny and highly instructive phenomenon of being utterly surprised by the high-level patterns generated by the models they themselves build.</p> <div class="quote" style="text-align:right;margin-top:9px;">&#8221;</div>

			<p class="quote-body">This outstanding book offers a tour d’horizon of agent-based modeling for students, teachers, and scientists at all levels, using NetLogo, the ‘low-threshold/unknown-ceiling’ language developed by Uri Wilensky. With this Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling, he and William Rand have set the standard for textbooks on this topic. An essential contribution.</p><div class="quote" style="text-align:right;margin-top:9px;">&#8221;</div>

			<p class="quote-body">A clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date introduction. This is the best book out there for learning (or teaching) the art and science of agent-based modeling. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in this essential area of complex systems science.</p><div class="quote" style="text-align:right;margin-top:9px;">&#8221;</div>

			<h2>Book Reviews</h2>
			<br/>
			<span class="quote">&#8220;</span>
			<p class="quote-body">The volume will be an excellent introductory textbook on agent­based modeling. Each chapter includes explorations on which students can test their understanding, and the examples in the textbook are included in the Models Library of the latest NetLogo download. At the same time, the book’s excellent discussions of model analysis and verification, validation, and replication, supported by NetLogo’s extensible architecture, make this an essential reference for the professional modeler.</p><div class="quote" style="text-align:right;margin-top:9px;">&#8221;</div>

			<p class="quote-body">This book is extremely well written, very readable, beautifully illustrated, and eminently accessible with alternating clear explanations and clearly explained code examples. As one delves more deeply into the book, he or she also delves more deeply into agent­ based modeling using the NetLogo software. It would be an excellent choice as a textbook for a course in agent­based modeling. If you do not have such a course, this book is so good that you might want to consider creating one. Outside of the classroom, if you are just interested in learning more about this fascinating emerging modeling technique, this book would be an excellent choice to bring you up to speed. This is one of the better books I have seen in a while on any technical topic. And if readers of this review are remotely interested in this topic, I would strongly encourage them to get a copy of this book.</p><div class="quote" style="text-align:right;margin-top:9px;">&#8221;</div>
