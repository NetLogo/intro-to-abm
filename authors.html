			Uri Wilensky, professor, is the founder and current director of the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at Northwestern University. Dr Wilensky is an associate professor of Learning Sciences and Computer Science, holds an appointment in the cognitive science program and is on the governing board of the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO). Dr. Wilensky received his PhD from the MIT Media Lab. He has developed many computational tools for use in both research and educational contexts. His NetLogo agent-based modeling software is a state-of-the-art modeling and representational infrastructure that is in wide use by researchers in the natural and social sciences. He has also used this software to restructure foundational courses, replacing much of the equational representations with agent-based representations. The overarching theme of his educational research has been the creation of a theory and pedagogy of Connected Learning. In particular, he has focused on developing computational tools that enable reconceptualization of traditional math and science disciplines. His most recent projects focus on developing tools that enable users to simulate, explore and make sense of complex systems. Prof. Wilensky has directed several mathematics and science education projects under the auspices of the National Science Foundation. In 1996, he received the NSF's Career Award. Having authored a number of computer-based learning environments, Prof. Wilensky has been actively developing new multi-agent modeling languages such as NetLogo as well as Participatory Simulation Toolkits such as HubNet. These tools are designed for both research and learning. NetLogo has tens of thousands of users worldwide, including scientists from a wide range of disciplines and students from middle school through graduate school. He is also a founder and an executive editor of the International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning.

			William Rand examines the use of computational modeling techniques, like agent-based modeling, geographic information systems, social network analysis, and machine learning, to help understand and analyze complex systems, such as the diffusion of innovation, organizational learning, and economic markets. He serves as the Director of the Center for Complexity in Business, the first academic research center focused solely on the application of complex systems techniques to business applications and management science. He also has an appointment with the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, and affiliate appointments with the Departments of Decision, Operations &amp; Information Technology and Computer Science. He received his doctorate in Computer Science from the University of Michigan in 2005 where he worked on the application of evolutionary computation techniques to dynamic environments, and was a regular member of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems, where he built a large-scale agent-based model of suburban sprawl. Before coming to Maryland, he was awarded a postdoctoral research fellowship at Northwestern University in the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO), where he worked with the NetLogo development team studying agent-based modeling, evolutionary computation and network science.Over the course of his research experience, he has used computer models to help understand a large variety of complex systems, such as the evolution of cooperation, suburban sprawl, traffic patterns, financial systems, land-use and land-change in urban systems, and many other phenomena. He has recently received research awards from Google / WPP, the National Science Foundation and the Marketing Science Institute.
