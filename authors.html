			<b>Uri Wilensky</b> is a professor of Learning Sciences, Computer Science and Complex Systems at Northwestern University. He also holds appointments in Cognitive Science, the program in Technology and Social Behavior and the Segal Design Center research council. He is the founder and current director of the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling and a co-founder of the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO). His NetLogo agent-based modeling software has hundreds of thousands of users worldwide, including scientists from a wide range of disciplines and students from middle school through graduate school. Dr. Wilensky received his PH.D from the MIT Media Lab. He has an abiding interest in the changing content of knowledge in the context of ubiquitous computation, and its implications for making sense of complexity. He has published more than 200 scientific papers, more than 1000 agent-based models across a wide range of content domains, and has received numerous grants including the NSF Career Award.

			<b>William Rand</b> examines the use of computational modeling techniques, like agent-based modeling, geographic information systems, social network analysis, and machine learning, to help understand and analyze complex systems, such as the diffusion of innovation, organizational learning, and economic markets. He serves as the Director of the Center for Complexity in Business, the first academic research center focused solely on the application of complex systems techniques to business applications and management science. He also has an appointment with the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, and affiliate appointments with the Departments of Decision, Operations &amp; Information Technology and Computer Science. He received his doctorate in Computer Science from the University of Michigan in 2005 where he worked on the application of evolutionary computation techniques to dynamic environments, and was a regular member of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems, where he built a large-scale agent-based model of suburban sprawl. Before coming to Maryland, he was awarded a postdoctoral research fellowship at Northwestern University in the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO), where he worked with the NetLogo development team studying agent-based modeling, evolutionary computation and network science.Over the course of his research experience, he has used computer models to help understand a large variety of complex systems, such as the evolution of cooperation, suburban sprawl, traffic patterns, financial systems, land-use and land-change in urban systems, and many other phenomena. He has recently received research awards from Google / WPP, the National Science Foundation and the Marketing Science Institute.
